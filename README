Install Coq and OCaml.

Download CompCert 2.4 from http://compcert.inria.fr/ and unpack it here.
Rename its directory to compcert (or create a symlink).

In the compcert directory:

  ./configure ia32-linux
  make
  make clightgen
  make documentation

Get back to the parent directory and make.  Ignore the warnings.

Run ./test_seccomp.native and you should see some output.
