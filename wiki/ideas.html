For now, this is a general infrastructure for creating kernel extensions.

* Define a DSL that the kernel accepts; the DSL spec
guarantees safety (e.g., no buffer overflow, no division by zero, or even no loops).

* Implement a compiler that translates a DSL program to machine instructions.

* Prove that the compiler is correct wrt the spec.

It would be great if we can extend this scheme to other kernel
components, such as filesystems, drivers,
and the [security subsystem](http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Projects).

NB: prove higher-level security properties (rather than memory safety, etc.)?

NB: ramfs looks simple, but others may be too complicated..

NB: we need to prove three things:
- the translation is correct;
- accepted seccomp programs never invoke undefined behavior;
- generated code always terminates.

NB: when CompCert doesn't work (e.g., no x86-64 backend), consider to invoke gcc or llvm
for code generation.  We then should at least do translation validation.  That means
we need to convert RTL to LLVM IR.

## Proof

The overall goal is to do backward simulation (refinement),
to proof that all possible behaviors of the IL are legal behaviors in the DSL.
This is hard to do in general.  So we can instead do forward simulation,
to proof that the IL has all good behaviors of the DSL,
and that the IL is deterministic, which gets backward simulation.
CompCert seems to have a nice library
[Smallstep.v](http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/html/Smallstep.html) that deals with the details.

[Forward and Backward Simulations Part I: Untimed Systems](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/TM-486.pdf), from Nancy.

Another interesting choice is the IL.
Cminor seems to be the right choice.
The RTL is too low-level (i.e., architecture-specific)
and requires global numbering of instructions,
which makes it much harder to prove anything.
Clight and Csharpminor
involve too much C detail, such as signed/unsigned integer types,
which we often don't really care.

## Syscall filtering

[seccomp](http://lwn.net/Articles/498231/).
Optmizations across filters may also be interesting (see DPF).

## Packet filtering

## Syscall batching

Xen's [multicall](http://lxr.linux.no/linux/arch/x86/xen/multicalls.h).

Linux's
[syslet proposal](http://people.redhat.com/mingo/syslet-patches/patches/async-core-docs.patch)
allows one to abort the execution of multiple syscalls on error,
such as the
[`SYSLET_STOP_ON_NEGATIVE` flag](http://lwn.net/Articles/221913/).

## Verifying file systems

[BilbyFs](http://plosworkshop.org/2013/preprint/keller.pdf).  Workshop
paper, work-in-progress.  Uses three DSLs to implement a file system,
generate C code from DSLs, prove functional correctness, no concurrency
or crash-recovery.

(e.g., bit errors in flash).  Working on a verified FS but no
results yet.  Follow-on:

## File system model-checking (not full verification)

## Systems programming with Idris

[Idris – Systems Programming meets Full Dependent Types](http://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/plpv11.pdf)

Could we use Idris to build a verified file system?

## Concurrency

## Bitcoin

[Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script): Bitcoin scripting system for transactions.

> Some of the more complicated opcodes are disabled out of concern that the client might have a bug in their implementation

For example: [bitcoin pull request 2604](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2604)

We could build a verified interpreter, giving developers confidence to extend the scripting language.

High security setting: bugs could lead to lost coins or forks in the blockchain.
