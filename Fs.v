(* Take a trivial history of file operations (e.g., [ (Read, 0) (Write, 1)
(Crash, 0) (Sync, 0) (Read, 1)]), and say whether it is legal.  Perhaps a proof
of an implementation of actual file operations, then would be a theorem saying
that the implementation produces only legal histories, and therefore is
correct. *)

(* A event returns whether its return value was legal and what the file's state
is after the processing the event. Write updates the in-memory state. Sync
flushes the in-memory state to on-disk state. Crash resets the in-memory state
to the on-disk state. n in (Read, n) must match the in-memory state of the file. *)
